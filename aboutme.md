I recently completed my master's degree in statistics from Baruch Zicklin School of Business. With eight years of analytics experience in statistical and financial modeling, in areas such as auto pricing and regulatory compliance, I am an unconventional thinker with the sharp skills and perseverance required for solving challenging and ambiguous problems. I know that the purpose of analytics is to bring value, whether in insurance or financial products. I am looking to leverage extensive background in analytics with my ability to solve real-world problems to help reduce costs and drive revenue.
